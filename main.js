 1. Create basic structure HTML
    Static HTML: the calculator itself, 5 rows of buttons, 4 columns
    I will have to flex out a collection of divs that sit under one wrapper
    allowing me to flex them accordingly.


  2. Add some CSS styling so I have a basic framework to work off of


  3. From there, I am going to select nodes with JS to add functionality to each
  button. Using functions and algorithsm, I need to creat code for:
    A. 'Clear' - Clears whatever content has been input into the calculator, causing
      the 'results screen' to revert back to the value 0.
    B. 'Results screen' - Whatever numbers or actions are taken, the resulting
      information will show up here. I need to figure out how to link the screen
      to all the other buttons, and ensure the info is logged correctly.
    C. Number buttons 1 - 9: Much like blackjack calculator, the values of these
      buttons correspond directly to the number.
    D. Math buttons (division, mult., sub, add) - Action buttons that will perform
      a task on whatver numbers are put into the calculator
    E. Equals - button that totals whatver math action that has been put in the
      system
    F. Decimal - adds a decimal to numbers.



  4. Once I have statically created each button with HTML, I will use JS to add
    event listeners for click and keyboard input (using number pad, /, X, -, +, =, .)



  5. I have to devise algorithms that actually accomplish whatever math action
    has been taken



    I am having a tough time mapping out which nodes I need to select and how
    dynamic content needs to be added to my calculator
